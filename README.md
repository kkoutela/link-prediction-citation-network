Link Prediction in Citation Networks

The problem we had to solve is related to predicting links in a citation network. In our case, the citation network is a graph G(V, E), where nodes represent scientific papers and a link between nodes u and v denotes that one of the papers cites the other. Each node in the graph contains some properties such as: the paper abstract, the year of publication and the author names. From the original citation network some randomly selected links have been deleted. Your job is given a set of possible links to determine which of them have been deleted and thus they appear in the original network.
